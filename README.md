## Description
This short course is designed for gaduated students of Zhejiang University. 

Models serve as the linchpin and key to understanding and transforming the world, embodying human wisdom and mastery. High-quality, high-reliability models are indispensable technical elements in electronics information and engineering technology sectors, forming the basis for optimized design, efficient operation, and intelligent control systems. They represent the sole pathway from experimental science through data analysis and mechanism comprehension towards precision, rule-governed, systemic outcomes. With system models as their core, industrial software has emerged as a driving force of modern industrial civilization.

This course introduces graduate students in the electrical information specialization to foundational methods for modeling, analyzing, simulating, designing, optimizing, and visualizing systems. It explores the common principles and methods behind dynamic modeling and analysis, experimental design and model analysis across various domains such as industrial production, electromagnetic scattering, optoelectronics imaging, biomedical engineering, and urban traffic management. The goal is to acquaint students with diverse mathematical models tailored for different purposes/attributes/characteristics, and to familiarize them with the fundamental methods of model construction, reduction, solution, and integration.

Moreover, this course aims to inspire students to maintain a forward-thinking perspective, foster dialectical thinking, and clarify technical logic by promoting interdisciplinary learning and innovation. This will enable students to delve deeply into the underlying principles behind key core technologies during their research endeavors, thereby contributing to the foundational support for achieving self-reliance and strength in science and technology.
